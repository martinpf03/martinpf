Hi, I am Martin,
I am a programmer, CTF player, future game developer who's studyng at IES Rodolfo Ucha. I am also working on an Erasmus Program 
consisting in AI programming with Robobo in Python.

I am currently learning Python, C# and I am also learning game development in Unity.

I've already been programming in Java and making cell apps in Flutter but in the future I am hoping to learn JavaScript and Web Designing with HTML and CSS.
Fun fact: I am typing this while I am inside a closet (Literally, not metaphorically)
